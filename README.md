# FREx
FREx (the **F**ramework for **R**ecommendations with **Ex**planations) is a Python package to support the development of recommender systems that use rule-based or knowledge-based steps in the recommendation process. 

## Usage

FREx is developed for Python 3.8+

You can use FREx by installing it via pip
```bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/solashirai/FREx@master#egg=frex
```
Note that one of the requirements, [ortools](https://pypi.org/project/ortools/), might require you to be using a 64-bit installation of Python. If you see installation errors related to ortools, consider swapping to a 64-bit Python (if you were using 32-bit) or checking that your pip is upgraded.

You will now be able to use FREx in your project like any other Python package, with `import frex`.

For updating or re-generating Sphinx documentation:
1. Go into the docs/ folder
2. run sphinx-apidoc -o source ../frex to generate .rst files. use -f option to force if needed,
but careful if you've made any manual changes to the rst files
3. run make html source build
